# Hi, I'm Priyanka 🦖🌈

🚀 Software Engineer | 🔐 Security+ Certified | 🧠 ADHD-Fueled Problem Solver  

I’m a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building impactful tools, shipping clean code, and understanding the *why* behind the systems I work with. I bring curiosity, persistence, and care into every project—and I'm continually exploring new ways to grow as an engineer and collaborator.

✨ Always open to conversations around tech, learning, ADHD & neurodiversity in engineering!
